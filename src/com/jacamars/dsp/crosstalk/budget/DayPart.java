/**
 * Created by Ben M. Faul on 9/24/17.
 * Creates a dayparting structure. Each key in the set is (dayNumber * 24) + hourOfDay  is an active time and is placed
 * in the set "parts".
 * Form of constructor data is:
 *{
 *  "monday":[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 *  "tuesday":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 *  "wednesday":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 *  "thursday":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 *  "friday":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 *  "saturday":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 *  "sunday":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
 *}
 *
 * If present day of week * 24 + hourOfDay is in the set in "parts" , then it is active, else it is not active.
